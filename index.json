Despite the importance of rainfall variability for vulnerable societies in tropical Africa, the relative influence of tropical waves for this region is largely unknown. This contribution is a follow-up study using the approach described in Schlueter at al. (2019a,b, J. Climate) for northern tropical Africa and presents the first systematic comparison of the impact of six types of tropical waves on precipitation over western (WEA) and eastern equatorial Africa (EEA), including the associated changes to atmospheric moisture budget terms. The study comprises the two rainy seasons in equatorial Africa, the March–May (MAM) and October–December (OND) seasons and used, apart from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, two satellite-based rainfall products, viz. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and (Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIPS) data sets, and a relatively dense rain gauge network in EEA only. Tropical wave activity is considered in the 5°N–5°S equatorial belt.  The study documents for the first time a strikingly different importance of the investigated six types of equatorial waves for rainfall variability in WEA and EEA. West of the western Rift mountains, over the Congo Basin, Kelvin waves and TDs dominate precipitation variability at the daily timescale, whereas over the East African Highlands, the slower modes, viz. the MJO and the Equatorial Rossby (ER) waves dominate at the weekly timescale. Over the adjacent tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean, wave activity is higher during MAM due to higher sea surface temperatures and related heavy oceanic rainfall. Consistent with earlier studies, the same statement holds for EEA, whereas in WEA wave activity is strongest in the second, moister rainy season in OND, especially at the Atlantic coast. Comparisons between the different rainfall datasets show very consistent results between TRMM and CHIRPS, whereas the station data indicate similar wave-related fluctuations, but higher mean rainfall during MAM in EEA.  Maps of variations in rainfall, moisture flux and moisture flux convergence, as well as columnar precipitable water (PW) during eight wave phases reveal that the rainfall modulation due to the waves is related to anomalies in the moisture flux and flux convergence. The wet MJO phase in EEA is associated with anomalous low-level westerlies over the Congo Basin after the MJO left Afrika towards the Indian Ocean. Yet, easterly anomalies at the East African coast lead to wetter conditions before the wet MJO phase overpasses the region. Over the EEA highlands, wetter conditions persist after the peak wet phase of the MJO. Westerly anomalies over the Congo Basin are related to an ER wave before its wettest phase crosses the EEA region. The modulation of rainfall by the ER waves is surprisingly high given the equatorial location. It appears that the slow MJO and ER waves lead to a moistening of the EEA highlands, potentially then favoring outbreaks of widespread convection in the course of the afternoon.  The Kelvin waves also modulate low-level moisture fluxes and convergence over the Congo Basin, but the impact on PW is less pronounced than in the MJO and ER case for EEA. Not surprisingly, the wet phase of the Kelvin waves are associated with anomalous convergence in enhanced low-level easterly flow over the Congo Basin. While rainfall fluctuations are strong and significant over the Congo Basin in the TD band, associated changes in the atmospheric moisture fields are mostly non-significant. Both, the origin of the variance in the TD band, i.e. African Easterly waves vs. independently westward moving mesoscale convective systems, and the thermodynamic and dynamic reasons for rainfall modulations, remain elusive. Whereas Mixed Rossby Gravity waves show no discernible signal, Eastward-Inertio Gravity (EIG) waves show significant, anti-symmetric rainfall anomalies straddling the equator. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, the importance of EIG waves for rainfall in the Congo basin has not been shown before. Like in the TD case, no related signal in the investigated atmospheric moisture variables is discernible.  The present study hints at significant, yet different roles of tropical waves over the Congo Basin and the East African Highlands, the demarcation line being the foothills of the western Rift mountains. The bulk of the rainfall modulation can be understood by modifications in the moisture content due to low-level wind changes, yet the causes of large, coherent and significant rainfall variations in the TD and EIG bands are unrelated to this. Irrespective of this, the large-scale wave controls on convection in the entire African equatorial belt suggest potential in their use for rainfall forecasting.","tags":null,"title":"A Systematic Comparison of Tropical Waves over Western and Eastern Equatorial Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Knippertz","Peter Vogel","Andreas H Fink","Andreas Schlueter","Tilmann Gneiting"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"302e2ce682f7aec195ac0efbb801d407","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/knippertz-skill-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.800043Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knippertz-skill-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Precipitation forecasts in the tropics potentially have a high economic value, but the quality of current numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensemble forecasts has not been evaluated in detail. In this study, we investigate the skill of two ensemble prediction systems (EPSs), namely those of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC), to issue predictions for the amount and occurrence of precipitation as well as for extreme precipitation events. We consider accumulation periods of 1–5 days and focus on the broad tropical belt between latitudes 30°S and 30°N. EPS data for the years 2009–2017 are taken from the TIGGE archive and are evaluated with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite rainfall estimates. In order to evaluate the full potential of ensemble forecasts, we apply the state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing technique Ensemble Model Output Statistics. Both raw and postprocessed forecasts are then compared to a static observation-based forecast, the so-called extended probabilistic climatology (EPC). The results are aggregated for different Köppen-Geiger climatic regions in the tropics. Raw ensemble forecasts from both models are uncalibrated and unreliable, with MSC forecasts often being slightly better calibrated and more reliable than their ECMWF counterparts. Raw ensemble forecasts for the amount and occurrence of precipitation as well as extreme precipitation of both models are slightly skillful for most climatic regions within the tropics, but not for northern arid and tropical Africa and regions with complex terrain. After postprocessing, forecasts are calibrated and skill is increased almost everywhere, with ECMWF forecasts being more skillful than MSC forecasts. Still, amount and occurrence of precipitation and extreme precipitation remain unpredictable for northern arid and tropical Africa and in complex terrain, while clear skill can be observed for most other regions.  Over the investigation period 2009–2017, the ECMWF raw ensemble forecasts show a period of clear improvement between 2009 to 2011 due to better calibration and some smaller improvements afterwards. The increase in horizontal resolution in 2010 probably contributed to this improvement. Postprocessed forecasts show little change in skill, indicating that the earlier forecasts benefitted more from the statistical corrections. There are, however, some regional differences. It is concerning that for several tropical regions, particularly the drier climates, no improvement in forecast skill, neither for raw nor postprocessed forecasts, can be observed for a period of almost one decade. In particular, as for many atmospheric variables clear improvements can be observed for the same period, this standstill in forecast improvement for precipitation forecasts needs further attention and investigation.","tags":null,"title":"Skill of Global Raw and Postprocessed Ensemble Predictions of Rainfall in the Tropics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Knippertz","Peter Vogel","Tilmann Gneiting","Andreas H Fink","Andreas Schlueter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9a167897525c2ff958bbfaa6c8011acb","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/knippertz-statistical-2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.803838Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knippertz-statistical-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Precipitation forecasts are of high socioeconomic importance for agriculturally dominated societies in northern tropical Africa. However, recent work has shown that state-of-the-art operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are not able to outperform climatology-based forecasts for 1–5-day accumulated precipitation during the monsoon season, even after applying sophisticated statistical post-processing methods in the form of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and ensemble model output statistics (EMOS). Raw ensemble forecasts are uncalibrated and unreliable, mostly due to poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. The parameterization of convection is a potential cause for the sobering lack of ensemble forecast skill in a region dominated by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). One possible alternative to dynamical model forecasts and post-processing are statistical forecasts based on spatio-temporal correlation patterns in past observations. Here, we investigate this approach exemplarily for the prediction of the probability of precipitation (PoP) in northern tropical Africa. Such an approach is deemed promising, as rainfall in this region is predominantly related to long-lived MCSs, which in turn are modulated by synoptic-scale African easterly waves (AEW). The results presented here are based on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite-based rainfall estimates during the period 1998–2014. The statistical model is developed for every grid-point using a logistic regression approach applied to the rainfall of the previous two days.  Results do indeed show correlation patterns consistent with MCS and AEW propagation but also indications of latitudinal shifts in the monsoon system. The statistical PoP forecasts are reliable and have a higher resolution than climatology-based forecasts. Improvements in the predictive performance in terms of the Brier score reach up to 20%. In view of the promising initial results, we will expand the concept to precipitation amounts, which we expect to be modulated by preceding rainfall characteristics as well, and possibly to other regions. Furthermore, we will explore whether statistical forecasts benefit from the inclusion of NWP predictions of larger-scale features such as regional moisture patterns, the African easterly jet or tropical wave modes.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Forecasts for the Occurrence of Precipitation Outperform Global Models over Northern Tropical Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Schlueter","Andreas H.

Despite this, relatively little is known about the quality of current numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensemble forecasts for precipitation at accumulation periods of one to a few days. Therefore in this comprehensive evaluation study, we systematically analyze for the first time NWP ensemble forecast skill for amount and occurrence of precipitation as well as the occurrence of extreme precipitation events for ten Köppen-Geiger climates in the tropics. We assess ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) for accumulation periods of 1–5 days against satellite-based gridded observations during the period 2009–2017. In order to evaluate the full potential of ensemble forecasts, we apply the state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing technique Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) and compare raw and postprocessed forecasts against a probabilistic forecast derived from past observations (referred to as “extended probabilistic climatology” or short EPC). Unprocessed forecasts from both ensemble systems are generally uncalibrated, overconfident and unreli- able. Despite this, they are (slightly) skillful for several Köppen-Geiger climates such as arid Australia or arid southern Africa. For tropical and northern arid Africa and in alpine climates, they have at best neutral skill. Statistical postprocessing improves forecast skill, and postprocessed forecasts for amount and occurrence of precipitation are skillful in most climates. In tropical and northern arid Africa and alpine climates, however, even postprocessed forecasts do not outperform EPC. For the occurrence of extreme events, we find similar results, in that ECMWF and MSC forecasts are skillful in most regions, but have at best neutral skill in tropical and northern arid Africa and alpine climates. We suspect three main problems, namely convective parameterization, model resolution, and observational errors as major causes for the poor performance of raw and postprocessed NWP ensemble predictions in the latter regions.

As current global numerical weather prediction systems fail to deliver accurate rainfall forecasts over tropical Africa, novel forecasting strategies are needed. Tropical waves are known to modulate precipitation over this region on timescales of a few days to several weeks. The aim of this dissertation is to quantify the influence of all major waves on rainfall variability over Africa, to investigate the involved mechanisms and, to test their potential for forecasting rainfall, with a focus on northern tropical Africa during the extended monsoon season.   Despite the importance of rainfall variability for vulnerable societies in tropical Africa, the relative influence of tropical waves for this region is largely unknown. This thesis closes this gap and presents the first systematic comparison of the impact of six wave types on precipitation over northern tropical Africa during the transition and full monsoon seasons, using two satellite products and a dense rain gauge network. Composites of rainfall anomalies based on different datasets show comparable modulation intensities in the West Sahel and at the Guinea Coast, varying from less than 2 to above 7 mm per day depending on the wave type. Tropical disturbances (TDs, including African Easterly Waves, AEWs) and Kelvin waves dominate the 3-hourly to daily timescale and explain 10-30% of precipitation variability locally. On longer timescales (7–20 days), only the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Equatorial Rossby (ER) waves remain as modulating factors and explain up to one third of rainfall variability. Eastward inertio-gravity (EIG)  waves and mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves are comparatively unimportant. An analysis of wave superposition shows that low-frequency waves (MJO, ER) in their wet phase amplify the activity of high-frequency waves (TD, MRG) and suppress them in the dry phase.   Furthermore, this dissertation gives the first systematic comparison of the dynamics and thermodynamics associated with tropical waves affecting rainfall variability over northern tropical Africa: Reanalysis and radiosonde data were analyzed for the period 1981–2013 based on space-time filtering of outgoing longwave radiation. The identified circulation patterns are largely consistent with equatorial shallow water theory. The slow modes, MJO and ER, mainly impact precipitable water, whereas the faster TDs, Kelvin waves, and MRG waves primarily modulate moisture convergence. Monsoonal inflow intensifies during wet phases of the MJO, ER, and MRG waves, associated with a northward shift of the intertropical discontinuity for MJO and ER waves. This study reveals that MRG waves over Africa have a distinct dynamical structure that differs significantly from AEWs. During passages of vertically tilted imbalanced wave modes, such as MJO, TDs, Kelvin, and partly MRG waves, increased vertical wind shear and improved conditions for up- and downdrafts facilitate the organization of mesoscale convective systems. The balanced ER waves are not tilted and rainfall is triggered by large-scale moistening and stratiform lifting. The MJO and ER waves interact with intraseasonal variations of the Indian monsoon and extratropical Rossby wave trains. The latter causes a trough over the Atlas Mountains associated with a tropical plume and rainfall over the Sahara. The presented results unveil which dynamical processes need to be modeled realistically to represent the coupling between tropical waves and rainfall in northern tropical Africa.   The potential of tropical waves as predictors for African rainfall was tested. The spatio-temporal correlation patterns of tropical waves highlight their potential for synoptic rainfall forecasting. The observed spatio-temporal properties agree with values predicted by shallow-water theory, with the exception of MRG and EIG waves, which have a strong phase dispersion at low wavenumbers. Unfiltered precipitation fields show correlations patterns that are physically explainable by tropical waves and other atmospheric phenomena such as the position of the tropical rainbelt. These correlations serve as predictors in a logistic regression model. It was shown that this model successfully predicts rainfall occurrence over Africa with a lead time of one day. The statistical model is calibrated and outperforms the climatological forecast and current numerical weather prediction models by about 20%. The fact that tropical waves explain large portions of synoptic to intraseasonal rainfall variability in almost the entire tropics emphasize the potential of the proposed statistical model. This PhD thesis has laid the foundation to exploit this potential and to significantly improve short-term weather forecasts in Africa and throughout the tropics.","tags":["Convectively coupled equatorial waves","Kelvin waves","Madden-Julian Oscillation","rainfall forecasting","rainfall variability","Rossby waves","statistical forecasting"],"title":"Tropical waves and rainfall over Africa: Variability, mechanisms and potential for forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Schlueter","Andreas H.

To fill this gap, the following wave types are analyzed for the extended West African monsoon seasons April to October: (1) the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), (2) Kelvin waves, (3) equatorial Rossby waves, (4) eastward-propagating inertio-gravity waves, (5) mixed Rossby-gravity waves and (6) tropical disturbances/African Easterly Waves. The different wave types are filtered in the wavenumber-frequency domain using outgoing longwave radiation. Eight different wave phases are defined from a phase diagram calculated from the time-derivative of the filtered wave signals following Yasunaga and Mapes (2012). Subsequently, composites of dynamical and thermodynamical fields for each wave phase of the different wave types are produced using the ERA Interim reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Finally, the influence of equatorial waves on West African precipitation is quantified using three rainfall datasets: (1) the gauge-adjusted three-hourly combined microwave-infrared estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V.7 for the period 1998–2016, (2) the Karlsruhe African Surface Station Database, which provides daily data from an extended rain gauge network for a period from 1979 to 2013, and (3) the gauge-calibrated, infrared based Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data V.2 (CHIRP/S) precipitation estimation, also for the period from 1979 to 2013.  All aforementioned wave types significantly influence West African rainfall and dynamics. The analysis of upper- and lower-level divergence, wind, and geopotential height largely confirms the structural characteristics expected from wave theory. The influence of the MJO and equatorial Rossby waves reaches far into the subtropics due to an interaction of the tropical and extratropical regimes. Station and satellite data confirm the influence on local precipitation, although significant differences exist in how strongly the wave types couple with precipitation and on which time scale. All equatorial waves – except the eastward-propagating inertio-gravity waves – modulate environmental conditions known to determine the frequency of occurrence, the intensity, and degree of organization of precipitation systems over West Africa. Favorable conditions for organization of convection prevail in Kelvin waves, African Easterly Waves, and the MJO. Contrarily, equatorial Rossby waves and partially the mixed Rossby-gravity waves tend to trigger large-scale rainfall by dynamic lifting.  The results emphasize the importance of a correct representation of equatorial waves in numerical weather prediction products for West Africa. Additionally, the statistical relationships found here indicate that statistical forecast models can be improved by including equatorial wave activity.","tags":null,"title":"Modulation of Precipitation over West Africa by Equatorial Waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joel Arnault","Thomas Rummler","Andreas Schlüter","Peter Knippertz","Andreas Fink","Harald Kunstmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6c87613dfeaf85f581f393bc62f0734d","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/arnault-sensitivity-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.802616Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arnault-sensitivity-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The interaction between soil moisture and precipitation is enhanced in transition zones between wet and dry regions. Therefore, it is plausible that a more realistic representation of soil moisture-related processes in an earth system model would improve the modeled precipitation in these transition zones. This research question is addressed in this study with the Weather Research and Forecasting model WRF and its coupled atmospheric-hydrological version WRF-Hydro, for the case of the West African Savannah. In standard WRF the terrestrial water flow is considered as being purely vertical. In WRF-Hydro this constraint is relaxed by the consideration of lateral redistribution of soil moisture according to topography and ground water depth. An ensemble of WRF and WRF-Hydro simulations is generated for the five-year period 2000-2004, based on varied initial soil moisture conditions. The atmospheric initial and lateral boundary conditions are provided by the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The selected WRF-Hydro setup uses a grid with 5 km horizontal spacing to represent atmospheric processes and a grid with 1000 m spacing to describe lateral terrestrial water flow. Precipitation results are validated against Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data (TRMM), surface evaporation results are validated against the Multi-Tree Ensemble Fluxnet dataset, and discharge results are validated against gauge observation from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) in four large West African river basins (Upper Niger, Bani, Black Volta, White Volta). The impact of lateral terrestrial water flow on modeled precipitation is assessed by comparing the normalized ensemble spread between the WRF and WRF-Hydro ensemble members.

This region is dominated by the West African monsoon, creating a unimodal rainfall peak in boreal summer in the Sahel and a bimodal distribution along the Guinea Coast. The main bulk of rainfall in the Sahel comes from highly organized mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). High-resolution limited-area numerical weather prediction (NWP) is still in its infancy in this region and therefore operational forecasting relies on global models and observations. In this study, we analyze the performance of nine operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) participating in TIGGE such as that of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We concentrate on the monsoon seasons 2007–2014 and the three regions West Sahel, East Sahel, and Guinea Coast. Both station data and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 gridded data set are used as observational references. Temporal aggregations from 1 to 5 days and spatial aggregations from 0.25°x0.25° to 5°x2° are considered. Past observations are used to construct a probabilistic climatology that forms the reference forecast against which skill is measured. In addition to the raw ensemble forecasts, we apply state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing methods in form of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS).  Raw ensemble forecasts are uncalibrated, unreliable, and underperform relative to climatology, independently of region, accumulation time, monsoon season, and ensemble. Differences between raw ensemble and climatological forecasts are large, and partly stem from poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. BMA and EMOS postprocessed forecasts are calibrated, reliable, and strongly improve on the raw ensembles, but – somewhat disappointingly – typically do not outperform climatology. Most EPSs exhibit slight improvements over the period 2007–2014, but overall have little added value compared to climatology. We suspect that one of the reasons for the sobering lack of ensemble forecast skill is the inability of the convective parametrizations in the TIGGE models to realistically represent processes of convective organization in a region dominated by MCSs.","tags":null,"title":"Skill of Global Raw and Postprocessed Ensemble Predictions of Rainfall over Northern Tropical Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Vogel","Peter Knippertz","Andreas H.

Due to the complex nature of convection, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle to deliver reliable and accurate predictions of rainfall for the tropics. For example, in a previous study, we have shown that a simple probabilistic climatology based on past observations at a given location and a given day outperforms raw ensemble precipitation forecasts from several NWP centers over West Africa. Even after the application of state-of-the-art statistical post-processing, forecasts have at best moderate skill compared to climatology. Here, we propose a new statistical method for the prediction of tropical rainfall using spatio-temporal correlations of rainfall as well as the phasing and intensity of convectively coupled equatorial waves, which have been shown to govern predictability of tropical precipitation on the synoptic timescale. The focus of this study is on predictions of the occurrence of precipitation and the probability of precipitation exceeding medium and high precipitation rates. The analyzed rainfall data are Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations for the years 1998 to 2014. To obtain probabilistic forecasts for the occurrence of precipitation we use logistic regression models with raw and wave-filtered precipitation as predictors on top of a suitably modeled climatology. The predictors are selected in such a way that they have the highest spatio-temporal correlation with the observation. The activity of equatorial waves is filtered in the wavenumber-frequency domain. For each year the model was trained on all remaining years and verified out-of-sample for that specific year.  Applied to northern tropical Africa, the new statistical model successfully forecasts precipitation probabilities and outperforms simple climatological as well as NWP forecasts. Spatio-temporal correlation patterns of raw precipitation with future rainfall can be ascribed to a mixture of influences of specific equatorial waves and the background state of the atmosphere. Over most parts of West Africa, the correlation structure mimics typical wavelengths and propagation speeds of African Easterly Waves. The forecast skill improves further if wave filtered precipitation is used as a predictor. The skill varies geographically with some regions such as the Guinea Coast showing scores up to 10% better than climatology and NWP models. This demonstrates the potential of relatively simple statistical models. We believe that this method can be also applied to other tropical regions where convectively coupled waves modulate precipitation. Particularly for tropical countries with limited computational power the statistical methods developed here can be a useful alternative to complex and expensive NWP forecasts. We are currently developing a toolkit that will semi-operationally forecast rainfall for the entire tropics.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Forecasting of Tropical Rainfall Based on Spatio-Temporal Correlations and Equatorial Waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Vogel","Andreas Schlueter","Peter Knippertz","Andreas H Fink","Tilmann Gneiting","Manuel Klar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6e2962df3ceae3d412e8ba77a86209e3","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/vogel-statistical-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.79675Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vogel-statistical-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Precipitation forecasts for one up to several days are of high socioeconomic importance throughout the tropics, regarding both the occurrence as well as the amount of precipitation. However, forecasts based on numerical weather prediction models and even statistically postprocessed forecasts hardly outperform simple reference forecasts such as climatology or persistence in parts of the tropics, especially over West Africa, and thus are of no practical use in these regions.  In this contribution, we investigate the potential of statistical forecasts based on near-real time observations to predict the occurrence of precipitation, while the prediction of rainfall amount will be addressed in the future. Starting from relatively simple climatology-based forecasts as a reference, we improve predictions by including spatio-temporal information contained in precipitation observations and illustrate this approach over West Africa. The derivation of the spatio-temporal properties of the precipitation fields require a full spatial coverage of precipitation observations and therefore we rely on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations. Especially for the strongest phase of the West African monsoon from end of June to end of September, precipitation fields exhibit clear spatio-temporal information that is meteorologically interpretable and statistically meaningful, and leads to improved forecasts.  While these forecasts already outperform persistent and climatological predictions, forecasts can be improved further through adding information on the activity of tropical waves. We illustrate this approach for Kelvin and African easterly waves over West Africa and test it throughout the tropics. While this approach is meteorologically meaningful and interpretable, it also yields improved forecasts.  These new results show some promise to eventually develop a computationally inexpensive statistical model that could be used in operational procedures and will generate better precipitation forecasts for parts of the tropics than the current state of the art.

For tropical climates, such models are generally more scattered. Arguably one of the most established and powerful concepts for low-latitude large-scale weather systems are equatorial waves based on linearized shallow-water systems as first discussed by Yanai, Matsuno and others in the 1960s. The simplest forms assume a weak horizontal temperature gradient and a resting basic state. All solutions decay away from the equator and can be separated into Kelvin, equatorial Rossby, mixed Rossby-gravity and inertia-gravity waves, all with their own characteristic patterns of geopotential, temperature, and wind perturbations, which typically oppose each other in the lower- and upper-troposphere. As the waves modulate convergence and divergence, they can couple with deep moist convection and the energy released maintains the waves against friction. This has led to the term convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). CCEWs can be identified from satellite-based outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) fields using space-time filtering. Interestingly, climatological results in wave frequency – zonal wavenumber space show two areas that are not solutions of the shallow water system: Large-scale, slow, eastward-moving signals associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and relatively small, fast, and westward moving so-called “tropical disturbances” (TDs). Tropical cyclones and easterly waves are typically subsumed under the TD category. For the African tropics, the boreal summer season is characterized by the West African monsoon (WAM) system. Large differences in temperature between the hot Sahara and cooler southern West Africa lead to the thermal African easterly jet (AEJ). Baroclinic-barotropic instability supports the formation of synoptic-scale African easterly waves (AEWs), which are intimately coupled with convection, particularly over the Sahel. These are usually characterized by two cyclonic vortices at 850 hPa straddling the AEJ to the north and south. There are sporadic reports in the literature of single vortices or slow-moving cyclonic-anticyclonic vortex couplets, but the involved physical mechanisms are unclear.  In June-July 2016 the DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa) project organized a major international field campaign in southern West Africa including measurements from aircraft, ground, and radiosondes. Careful daily synoptic analyses were produced to guide flight-planning and post-analysis of observations. The results are a strong illustration of the richness of features encountered over the African tropics in summer. Three types of behaviors can be distinguished: The first type is classical AEWs with a northern and southern cyclonic vortex. They usually have a discernable signal in vorticity, wind, and precipitation fields. Particularly before the monsoon onset, a second type, single cyclonic vortices, occur at different latitudes with different propagation speeds. They fall into the TD filter window and are often related to long-lived mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and thus modulate rainfall on the regional scale, but the exact dynamical reason for their existence is not entirely clear. The third type, which appears to be rarer and whose climatological and dynamical characteristics are barely covered in the literature, are jointly propagating cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices, which create an anomalous westerly flow in between them. The resulting conditions appear to depend on the origin of the involved air masses. If the westerly flow taps into moist air off the West African west coast, where high sea-surface temperatures are common, this can lead to anomalously moist conditions across the region. More work is needed to develop conceptual models for the latter two types of disturbances that share characteristics of both equatorial (e.g., mixed Rossby-gravity waves) and AEW features.","tags":null,"title":"The Challenge of Classifying Propagating Synoptic Disturbances in the African Tropics – Examples from the DACCIWA Field Campaign","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Knippertz","Andreas H.

We use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) as state-of-the-art postprocessing methods and verify against station and gridded Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations. Based on a subset of past forecast—observation-pairs, statistical postprocessing corrects ensemble forecasts for biases and dispersion errors. For the midlatitudes, statistical postprocessing has demonstrated its added value for a wide range of meteorological quantities and this contribution is the first to apply it to precipitation forecasts over West Africa, where the high degree of convective organization at the mesoscale makes precipitation forecasts particularly challenging. The raw ECMWF ensemble predictions of accumulated precipitation are poor compared to climatological forecasts and exhibit strong dispersion errors and biases. For the Guinea Coast, we find a substantial wet bias of the ECMWF ensemble and more than every second ensemble forecast fails to capture the verifying observation within its forecast range. Postprocessed forecasts clearly outperform ECMWF raw ensemble forecasts by correcting for biases and dispersion errors, but disappointingly reveal only slight, if any, improvements compared to climatological forecasts.

We investigate different spatial accumulation sizes from 0.25 x 0.25◦ to 5 x 2◦ longitude—latitude-boxes for gridded observations and find consistency in the results across the spatial aggregation size. This implies that the precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF, arguably one of the world’s best numerical weather prediction centers, have major deficiencies over West Africa that can not only be attributed to dislocation errors of individual convective systems or dispersion errors and biases in the raw ensemble forecast.

Due to the complex nature of convection, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models largely fail to deliver reliable and accurate precipitation forecasts for the tropics. In this study, we propose a new statistical method for the prediction of tropical rainfall using the information about the phasing of equatorial waves.  For certain temporal and spatial scales, statistical forecast methods for tropical precipitation have skill comparable to complex and expensive numerical predictions. For example, recent work has shown that climatology or persistence forecasts, thus a very simple statistical model, performs as well as postprocessed ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) over tropical Africa. Thus, we believe that additional exploitation of information about the larger-scale atmospheric setting could lead to statistical forecast models of tropical precipitation that are comparable or even more accurate than current NWP forecasts.  Predictability of tropical precipitation on the synoptic timescale is mainly governed by convectively coupled equatorial waves which modulate the distribution and intensity of rainfall. Therefore, information about the phasing and intensity of equatorial wave activity should be included in statistical models for tropical rainfall. Here, we present a simple statistical forecast that incorporates information about these waves. To obtain knowledge about future wave phasing, the current wave signal can be extrapolated or filtered from signals in NWP output.  Exemplarily, we tested the improvement of forecast quality over two locations in West Africa using the a priori knowledge about the phasing of these equatorial waves. For both locations, equatorial waves successfully predict rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount. The new model clearly outperforms the ECMWF forecast. This demonstrates the great potential of such relatively simple statistical-dynamical models. We are confident that our method has also great potential for the operational application of rainfall prediction in other tropical regions and this will be tested in the future.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical forecasting of tropical rainfall using equatorial waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Vogel","Tilmann Gneiting","Peter Knippertz","Andreas Fink","Andreas Schlüter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"7facf90996738bb2df73db5df535950a","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/vogel-statistical-2016/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.799463Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vogel-statistical-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Statistical postprocessing for ensemble forecasts has undergone many improvements recently. Commonly used methods are Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS), but have pre- dominantly been applied over the midlatitudes (e.g. North America or Europe). The prediction of precipitation events during the wet period of the West African Monsoon (WAM) is highly chal- lenging and ensemble forecasts for precipitation in West Africa during this period have low skill. The present contribution investigates for the first time how statistical postprocessing methods can improve precipitation fore- casts to obtain calibrated and sharp predictive distributions. Perhaps surprisingly, the ECMWF ensemble is unable to outperform climatological forecasts. However, BMA and EMOS postprocessed forecasts can cope with the poor quality of the raw ensemble forecasts and yield predictive distributions that are as calibrated as, but sharper than, climatology.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical postprocessing for precipitation forecasts during the West African Monsoon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Schlueter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"da83446352679925ae142c62696c6dbf","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/schlueter-impact-2015/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.800603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schlueter-impact-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Impact of Climate Modes and Precipitation on Tanzanian Maize","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Schlüter","Weiqing Han","Katja Friedrich","Alexander Knohl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"2bcadffcc2778cfccb471e31c9e705ef","permalink":"http://www.andreasschlueter.com/publication/schluter-impact-2015/","publishdate":"2020-06-09T20:23:14.803177Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schluter-impact-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous research has shown the significant impact of the two climate modes El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on the interannual variability of Tanzanian rainfall. However, the relationship of these modes to crop yield in a country where agriculture is predominantly rain-fed has not yet been investigated. This study analysed in three steps the impact of ENSO and IOD, as well of the regional precipitation on maize yield in the East African country Tanzania. Correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate the relationship between monthly climate indices and precipitation and annual maize yield data. IOD was shown to have positive and mostly statistically significant correlation with precipitation throughout almost entire Tanzania during October to February. ENSO has a comparably negligible, mostly non statistically significant impact on the Tanzanian rainfall. It was indicated, that the right timing of the precipitation is crucial for a good development of maize. From January to April, crops show increased susceptibility to drought. Too early precipitation (from August to December) can lead to crop failure. About half of the regions showed a month with statistically significant correlation of maize yield with precipitation. IOD is generally negatively correlated with the maize yield during September to November and positively during December to April. IOD has a stronger impact on maize yield than ENSO. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the Indian Ocean in future research. The available data was not sufficient to prove that climate modes affect the maize yield only via precipitation. A better understanding regarding climate modes effect on agriculture can contribute to a robust supply of food in a country, where food production comes mostly from rain-fed agriculture.","tags":null,"title":"The Impact of Climate Modes and Precipitation on Tanzanian Maize Yield","type":"publication"}]
