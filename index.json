In his Schmidt Science Fellowship year, he will draw on this experience and expertise to develop a real-time crop-yield prediction model for Africa. With the Ermon Lab at Stanford, Andreas aims to achieve this via a combination of real-time satellite observations, weather forecasts, and machine learning techniques. Using neural networks, he hopes to also build on investigations he has previously led on the influence of variable oceanic modes such as the El-Niño in the Pacific Ocean on crop yields in Tanzania, with the goal of testing whether such models can be used as predictors for crop yield more widely.\nAndreas is excited by the potential of interdisciplinary ‘computational sustainability’. He hopes to contribute to this new field as it aims to address sustainability challenges through computational methods.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://www.andreasschlueter.com/author/dr.-andreas-schlueter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr.-andreas-schlueter/","section":"authors","summary":"Andreas
